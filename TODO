- Accept urls from the command line. This option it's more useful if gwget could detect if another instance of gwget it's already running and add the download to the current gwget (as gedit do for text file). Read gedit source for ideas.
- Put more wget options in preferences window.
- Epiphany extension. I have implemented the skeleton (not yet committed to cvs).

Done:
- Make it remember if you want or don't want a Toolbar (Done in 0.11).
